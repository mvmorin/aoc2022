Every day is a separate module called 'dayXX. Each problem is a test function of the corresponding module called 'dayXX', or 'dayXX_YY' if it has several parts. Run a test and show its output with 'cargo test dayXX -- --show-output', or run the included shell script, i.e., './test-with-output dayXX'.
